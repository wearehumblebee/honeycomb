# Themes

With styled-system, you can easily override style props on the fly.

But adjusting your components locally increase their specificity:

How to ensure your components respect the design guidelines?

A Theme acts as a contract reference for your components:
This is where you define:

- the design tokens that will be used by your components
- the specific variants of components that should be (re)used

## Designing a theme for your project

Themes must respect the [Theme Specifications](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec).
We can use theme-ui's `merge` helper to extend a preset, in order to get a specifications headstart.

```jsx
// '[path-to-your-themes]/CustomTheme';
import { merge } from 'theme-ui';
// That or any other preset ;)
// https://theme-ui.com/packages/presets
import { base as preset } from '@theme-ui/presets';

const CustomTheme = merge(preset, {
  // ... And here we go!
  // Design Tokens
  breakpoints: [
    // mobile-first breakpoints
    '40em', // (640px, unless you override the page's default font-size of 16px)
    '56em', // (896px, unless you override the page's default font-size of 16px)
    '64em', // (1024px, unless you override the page's default font-size of 16px)
  ],
  colors: {
    // ...
    text: 'black',
    background: 'white',
    primary: 'blue', // important: "background" and "primary" should be different!
    secondary: 'midnightblue',
  },
  // Components variants
  // https://theme-ui.com/components/variants/
  buttons: {
    primary: {
      bg: 'primary',
      color: 'white',
    },
    secondary: {
      bg: 'secondary',
      color: 'black',
    },
    // ...
  },
  // ...
});

export default CustomTheme;
```

As a frontend developer, this is where your work starts.

If the theme is too strict, building UI components will be slower.
If the theme is too flexible, respecting design guidelines becomes harder.

Your role will be to find the good balance for your project ™️.
This will probably require several updates of the theme, and alignments your designer(s).

## Wrap your application with the theme

theme-ui allows to customise the appearance of your UI components by wrapping your application under a `<ThemeProvider />`.
This component takes a prop called `theme` which needs to be an object respecting the Theme specifications.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from 'theme-ui';

import CustomTheme from '[path-to-your-themes]/CustomTheme';

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    <AppRouter />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

## With TypeScript

You can use base types to ensure your Theme is valid.

You can go even further with specific types and/or interfaces for variants and/or tokens according to your needs

```tsx
import { merge, Theme } from 'theme-ui';
import { base as preset } from '@theme-ui/presets';

const CustomTheme: Theme = merge(
  preset as Theme,
  {
    colors: {
      primary: 'red',
    },
  } as Partial<Theme>,
) as Theme;
```

## Feeding your theme with Figmagic design tokens

The theme provides rules for your components that you can reuse everywhere.

But going further on the design-development synchronisation:
It would be even better to sync the tokens with the designers!

At Humblebee, we work with Figma and the [figmagic project](https://github.com/mikaelvesavuori/figmagic), allowing to extract specific values from a Figma document.

You will need a document model that is pre-defined for such extraction, but you can customise it according to your needs.

Once this is setup, sync the tokens from the Figma document:

```bash
figmagic -base ./tokens
```

This should generate design tokens files inside `./tokens`.

Now, back to your theme definition, all we need is to import their values and use it to build our theme:

```jsx
// '[path-to-your-themes]/CustomTheme';
// ...
import colors from 'tokens/colors';
import fontFamilies from 'tokens/fontFamilies';
// ...

const CustomTheme = merge(preset, {
  // Design Tokens
  colors: {
    // tokens names are arbitrary, use whatever you wish -- Theme specification encourage specific values though!
    primary: colors.primary,
  },
  fonts: {
    body: fontFamilies.body,
    heading: fontFamilies.heading,
  },
  // ...
});

export default CustomTheme;
```
