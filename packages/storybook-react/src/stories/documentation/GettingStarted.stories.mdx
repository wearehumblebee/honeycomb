# Getting Started

@humblebee/ui-react is an unopinionated, theme-able UI library based on theme-ui.
It provides white-label components and utils that you can customise using a Theme.

To get started, simply install it from npm using your favorite package manager:

## Install Package

Use the following command to install the React package using yarn.

```bash
yarn add theme-ui @theme-ui/presets @humblebee/ui-react
```

Or using NPM.

```bash
npm i -S theme-ui @theme-ui/presets @humblebee/ui-react
```

## Hello World

Once this is done, jump to the next steps and build a theme to wrap your application with:

```jsx
import AmeyzinTheme from '[path-to-your-themes]/MyAmeyzinTheme';

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={AmeyzinTheme}>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

## TypeScript support
