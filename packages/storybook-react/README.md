# Honeycomb Storybook documentation

[Humblebee](https://www.humblebee.se/) is a digital product and service studio based in GÃ¶teborg, Sweden.

We believe in the values Open Source projects bring us on a daily basis, and those packages are our modest contribution.

We hope you will like them as much as we do :)

PS: we are always looking for talented and creative mindsets, if you are interested, [reach out to us](https://www.humblebee.se/contact) :)
