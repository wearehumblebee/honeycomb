## About Humblebee

[Humblebee](https://www.humblebee.se/) is a digital product and service studio based in G√∂teborg, Sweden.

We believe in the values Open Source projects bring us on a daily basis, and those packages are our modest contribution.

We hope you will like them as much as we do :)

PS: we are always looking for talented and creative mindsets, if you are interested, [reach out to us](https://www.humblebee.se/contact) :)

## Getting started

Install the packages from your favorite package manager

```bash
npm i -S theme-ui@next @humblebee/ui-react # or yarn
```

NOTE: [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/) is currently being [converted to TypeScript](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/issues/668) and has an open Roadmap for its v1:
https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/issues/832

Some changes will probably be required from time to time until that release.
